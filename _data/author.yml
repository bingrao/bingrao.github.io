  desc: 'I am  a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.cs.ucf.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at
        the <a href="http://www.ucf.edu/">University of Central Florida</a>. My current research interest
        is the design and analysis of parallel systems for big-data computing. For the aspect of design,
        I am currently working on optimizing performance, resilience of data-intensive computing. For the
        aspect of analysis, I focuses on using program analysis to detect programming errors and performance
        defects in large-scale parallel computing systems.'
